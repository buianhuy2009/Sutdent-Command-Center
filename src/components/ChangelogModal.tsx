    badge: 'Latest Update',
    highlights: [
      'Pressing Save & Sync in Canvas now syncs with the credentials you just typed — no more empty list with no error',
    ],
    details: [
      'Canvas (Canvas LMS tab in App.tsx + CanvasSyncTab.tsx): Save & Sync now passes the freshly-saved URL, token and feed link directly to the sync engine instead of re-reading stale state, so first-time setup no longer hits the empty-credentials early return that cleared the list and showed no red error banner. Retry buttons call the same path without arguments.',

    title: 'Canvas Sync Fix — Honest Errors When the Server API Is Down',
    highlights: [
      'Canvas sync now tells you when the problem is the deployment itself — not your token or feed link',
      'No more misleading “bad token” or “network” errors when the site’s API is actually unreachable',
      'Local development reaches the Canvas + AI endpoints automatically, no extra server step needed',
    ],
    details: [
      'Canvas (Canvas LMS tab + sync engine): before any sync, the app checks its own /api/health endpoint. If it answers with a web page instead of JSON — what happens when the deployed server functions are missing or replaced — sync stops immediately with one clear message telling you to redeploy, instead of blaming your Canvas URL, token or connection. Calendar-feed failures now carry the same typed error kinds as API failures.',
      'Development (vite.config.ts): running just `npm run dev:vite` now proxies /api to the app server on port 3000, so the Canvas proxy and AI endpoints work without also starting the express server.',

    highlights: [
      'Math formulas in AI answers now render beautifully — fractions, integrals and equations instead of raw $ symbols',
      'Works everywhere AI writes: Study Coach, Feynman explanations, quizzes, PhotoMath and STEM Lab',
      'Vietnamese text inside formulas never shows as boxes, long equations scroll sideways',
    ],
    details: [
      'AI answers (Study Coach, Socratic Tutor, Feynman 3-tier explanations, Quiz Generator, PhotoMath handwritten solver, STEM Lab, Document Hub, NotebookLM briefs): one shared MathMarkdown renderer shows Markdown plus KaTeX math — inline $...$ and display $$...$$ — with streaming-safe balancing so half-typed formulas never flash raw code while the answer is still arriving. The AI prompt now asks for KaTeX delimiters directly.',
      'Theme & language (stylesheet + KaTeX fonts): formulas inherit the Warm Cream / Charcoal theme ink in both modes, display equations scroll horizontally instead of overflowing, and Vietnamese diacritics inside math fall back to Inter so they never render as tofu boxes. Code blocks and GFM tables inside AI answers are styled to match.',

    title: 'Claude Palette, VI/EN Toggle, Calmer Toolbars & Honest Canvas',
    highlights: [
      'Whole app now follows the Anthropic Claude palette — canvas, hairline borders and primary accent',
      'New Vietnamese / English toggle in the navbar, landing header, footer and Settings — auto-detects on first visit',
      'Master Tracker toolbar decluttered — filters, export and sheet link moved into a Filters panel, AI Rank merged into Smart Add',
      'Canvas failures show one clear banner only (no more duplicate popup) and never wipe your loaded assignments',

      'Palette (theme, stylesheet, app shell): tokens move to Claude official values — canvas #F5F4ED, warm-sand borders #E8E6DC, primary #C96442, muted #5E5D59. Avatar badges drop off-palette blue/emerald/purple for Claude neutrals, and error toasts use the dark surface instead of the old rose block. Find it in Settings → Appearance.',
      'Language (navbar, landing, Tracker, Canvas, Settings → General): every chrome string goes through one dictionary with auto-detect (browser Vietnamese → Vietnamese) saved per device. Deep AI-generated content stays in its source language by design.',
      'Tracker (Master Tracker header): removed the Export CSV button, standalone Sheet pill and Timeline toggle from the main row. Subject/status/priority filters, CSV export and Open Sheet live behind the new Filters icon; AI Rank now sits inside the Smart Add bar. Canvas tab pills wrap cleanly and the Settings → General Tour + Changelog cards merge into one Help & updates row.',
      'Canvas (Canvas LMS tab): the same failure used to fire both an inline banner and an identical popup. Only the banner shows now, the message is shortened to a single fix, failed syncs keep your cached assignments (now persisted across reloads) instead of blanking the list.',
      'Homepage (logged-out landing): new section nav (Features, How it works, FAQ, Privacy), a 3-step setup guide built from the real connect flows, and honest product cards instead of quote-styled testimonials. No invented users, counts or videos.',

    title: 'True Palette, Point-At-You Tour & Honest Canvas Errors',
    highlights: [
      'Every screen now follows the Warm Cream / Charcoal / Terracotta palette in both modes — no more blue or slate intruders',
      'The intro tour now points directly at the real buttons and auto-moves you between tabs as you press Next',
      'Canvas tells you plainly when a sync returns nothing — expired feed links and bad tokens get a named fix, not a fake “all caught up”',

    details: [
      'Landing page, Daily Schedule, Google sign-in help, focus scheduler and Polite Mailer were still rendering slate-gray surfaces with indigo, blue, cyan and orange accents. All surfaces, text, borders and buttons now use Warm Cream #FAF9F5, Charcoal #141413 and Terracotta #D97757 in both modes, with a stylesheet safety net catching future stragglers. App icons keep their brand colors.',
      'The old tour was a centered card that described the UI in words and made you find everything yourself. It is now a spotlight walkthrough: a terracotta ring highlights the live sidebar, search, Sync, Tracker, AI Coach and Focus targets, and pressing Next or Back moves you to the right tab automatically. X skips, dots jump, Esc closes, and “Try it” ends the tour and opens the real feature.',
      'When Canvas was misconfigured, the tab showed an empty “All caught up!” with no error. Expired feed links (which return a login page), dead tokens and unreachable hosts now raise a named error banner with the exact fix and a Try Again button, and a configured-but-empty sync explains itself instead of pretending everything is done.',
      'The sync merged assignments by bare name only, so “Problem Set 1” in Physics and Math collapsed into one row. Merging now keys on name + course + due date.',

      'Dashboard countdowns, timetable “now” line and Gantt today-line keep today’s plan in view',

      'Dashboard + Schedule (012/021/037): live countdown chips to your next deadline, a “now” line across today’s timetable, and saved schedule presets so a normal school day takes one tap to rebuild.',
      'Focus + Morning (013/020/042/043): Pomodoro polish with steadier transitions, morning check-in now logs mood alongside intention and target hours, chronotype preference persists, and Feynman explanations show estimated read time.',
      'Search + Shortcuts (018/019/026/032): press ? to see every shortcut with search, command palette does math and copies the result, remembers your 10 recent tabs plus most-used apps, and the App Store finds tools as you type.',
      'Gmail + Drive (033/035/036): inbox categories show unread badges, unread state is a reliable flag instead of a guess, and Drive sorts by name, date or size so big files surface fast.',
      'Study loop (015/016/017/023/027/028/029/030/031/034/038/044/045): friendlier empty states, flashcard keyboard review with smart scheduling, quiz presets with timer, scholarship deadlines with badges, habit + sleep streaks, hardened study cards, citation one-click copy, paper-chat brief download, peer Q&A replies, and wiki copy that keeps formatting.',
      'Landing (014): hero is clearer on phones and laptops — faster first paint, cleaner headline, and no confusing placeholder video.',

      'The old 8-palette theme picker fought with the Dark/Light toggle and could leave the app in tinted or half-dark states. There are now exactly two modes: Warm Cream light (#FAF9F5 / #141413) and Dark Charcoal dark (#141413 / #FAF9F5), both with the terracotta accent. Any old tinted setting migrates automatically.',

It now opens a help window naming the exact problem — for example “blocked by your admin, try a personal Gmail” — with the precise fix for each case.',
      'Some browsers (strict popup or cookie blockers, in-app browsers) never let the Google popup answer. A new “Redirect sign-in instead” button takes you to Google and back in the same tab, which works where popups cannot. A 90-second safety timer also stops the loading spinner from hanging forever.',
      'Previously, if the popup was blocked the app sent you to Google and back but never confirmed anything or started syncing, which felt broken. Returning from Google now shows a success message and runs a full sync immediately.',
      'The sign-in help window has a “Run connection check” button that tests your Firebase setup, website address, popups and cookies, and tells you which one to fix. Also fixed the page security rules so Google’s login helpers are never blocked.',

    ],
    details: [
      'Some students tapped “Enter LMS Workspace” and got a blank page. This happened when a single assignment record was missing its title (from an old save, an email scan, or a blank spreadsheet row) — it crashed the page with no way back. Every list is now cleaned automatically, and a last-resort safety screen with a “Back to Dashboard” button catches anything unexpected.',
      'When Canvas sync failed, the tab said “All caught up!” with zero tasks, which looked broken and empty. It now shows a clear error box explaining the problem with a Try Again button, and keeps your previously loaded assignments visible.',
      'Google only lets popup sign-ins last about an hour. The app now trades the first sign-in for a permanent offline grant and renews access silently through a secure server route — the client secret never leaves the backend, and revoked access simply returns you to the Connect state with your cached data intact.',
